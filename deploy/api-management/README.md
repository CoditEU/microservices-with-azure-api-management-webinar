==============================

This folder contains all artifacts to deploy to your own Azure API Management resource:

- **Developer Portal** contains all the resources to run the Developer Portal yourself.
    - More information on how to host it yourself can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-developer-portal)
